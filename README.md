# Accessibility with aXe

Accessibility playground with [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core).

WARNING: This code uses [Samuel L. Ipsum](http://slipsum.com/) and is probably not suitable for work.

## Making sense of this thing

I started trying to write a badly formed web page with headings out of order and links used poorly so I could see how axe-core works and write custom rules. I got a bit sidetracked with range sliders and live areas.

* The markup is in `index.html`
* Custom aXe rules are in `js/main.js`
* UI behavior logic is in `js/chicken-scratch.js`

Good luck.
